# NightCampus dataset

## 1. Introduction

The NightCampus dataset is a real night dataset with 12-bit raw images.

The dataset contains 220 scenes, and every scene contains two to four pairs of long-exposure images, over 20 pairs of short-exposure images and a dense point cloud. All short-exposure image pairs have an identical exposure time. The **clean images** for every scene are generated by averaging the sequence of the short-exposure images.
